          <h3>Hallasan National Park</h3>
					<p>
						<img src="../images/hallasan.jpg" alt="Hallasan Mountain" class="imgLeft" />
						Hallasan Mountain rises up proudly from the center of Jeju Island and is
						 perhaps the island’s most memorable landmarks. Also called Mt. Yeongjusan,
						 meaning "mountain high enough to pull the galaxy," Hallasan Mountain is
						 widely known by scientists for its geological value. Designated as a
						 national park in 1970, there are 368 parasitic volcanoes called Oreums
						 (peaks) around the main mountain. </p>
          <h3>Manjanggul Cave</h3>
					<p>
						<img src="../images/Manjanggul.jpg" alt="Manjanggul" class="imgRight" />
						Lava Tube is located in Gimnyeong-ri, Gujwaeup, Jeju City. At 23m high,
					 30m high and 8.928km long, it is the 12th-longest lava tube in the world
					 and the second longest on Jeju island. It is regarded as having
					 significant scientific and heritage value, owing to its excellent
					 condition of preservation despite its age of formation (about 300,000
					 to 200,000 years ago).</p>
          <h3>Seongsan IlChulbong Park(tuff cone)</h3>
					<p>
						<img src="../images/SeongsanIlchulbong.jpg" alt="Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone" class="imgLeft" />
						Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak rose from under the sea in a volcanic eruption
					 over 100,000 years ago. Located on the eastern end of Jejudo Island, there
					 is a huge crater at the top of Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak. The crater is
					 about 600m in diameter and 90m high. With the 99 sharp rocks surrounding
					 the crater, it looks like a gigantic crown. While the southeast and north
			 		 sides are cliffs, the northwest side is a verdant grassy hill that is
			  	 connected to the Seongsan Village. The ridge provides an ideal spot for
			  	 walks and for horse riding as well.
			  	 The sunrise from the crater is magnificent. Also the Seongsan Ilchulbong
					 peak surrounded by bright yellow colored canola flowers in the spring is
			  	 truly a sight to behold.</p>

        	<h3>Jungmun Saekdal Beach</h3>
					<p>
						<img src="../images/JungmunBeach.jpg" alt="Jungmun Beach" class="imgLeft" />
						With a slope of 5 degrees and average depth of 1.2m, Jungmun Saekdal Beach is
					 characterized by white arch-shaped sandy shore and four distinctive colored
					 sands of white, black, red and gray called jinmosal. This colorful sandy beach
					 is 560m in length and 50m in width and has appeared in several dramas and
					 movies thanks to its beautiful scenery created by Jeju Island’s black basalt
					 and jinmosal. The cliffs that line the shore on the right leads to a naturally
					 formed 15m-long cave. The cliffs are also a habitat for many rare species,
					 serving as a perfect spot for an ecology tour. Jungmun Beach offers a variety
					 of marine sports such as parasailing, water skiing, windsurfing, scuba diving,
					 rafting, and yacht tour for an exciting vacation under the sun.</p>
					<h3>Soesokkak Estuary</h3>
					<p>
						This place is completely awesome. Swesoggak is a river that flows into the
					 ocean, making for a weird mix of warm, salty water on top and refreshingly
					 ice-cold water below. There are rocks to dive from and a few nice platforms to
					 climb down to and have a picnic.
					 Next to the river is an interesting black-sand beach that is constantly being
					 worked on to make swimmable (there are too many rocks for easy entrance into
					 the water). There is occasional surf here.</p>
					<h3>Hyeopjae Beach</h3>
					<p>
						<img src="../images/HyeopjaeBeach.jpg" alt="Hyeopjae Beach" class="imgRight" />
						Hyeopjae Beach is one of the best beaches on Jeju Island for swimmers,
						since the waters are shallow with no sudden drops. Tiny shells in the
						sand give the beach a silver sheen and make for a firm feel that is perfect
						for long walks along the water’s edge. Once you get into the water,
						you’ll be pleased to discover that the water is so clear that you’ll
						be able to look down and see your toes!</p>

				<h2 class="desktop">Jeju Olle Walking</h2>

        	<h3>Jeju Olle Walking</h3>
					<p>
						<img src="../images/OlleTrail.jpg" alt="Jeju Olle Walking" class="imgLeft" />
						Jeju Olle Trail is a long-distance foot path on Jeju Island, an island off the
					 south-west coast of South Korea. The overall route, mostly following the
					 coastline, consists of 21 connected numbered main routes, 5 sub-routes, and a
					 short spur that connects to Jeju International Airport. The routes have an
					 average length of 16 km and all together total 422 km. The exact length and
					 locations change over time as trails are modified or re-routed.</p>
					<p>Jeju Olle Trail was founded by ex-journalist Suh Myung-suk, who worked for
					 Sisa Journal and the original citizen journalism web site, Oh My News.
					 Exhausted after strenuous years working as a journalist, she felt a need to
					 refuel herself. As a way to do this, she walked the Camino de Santiago in
					 Spain. Suh Myung-suk was highly impressed and inspired by the trip, so she
					 decided to create a similar hiking trail on her home island of Jeju. After
					 organizing a team for her goal, she started the time-consuming project of
					 discovering and creating hike-able routes on the island. Suh opened her
					 first trail to the public in September 2007.</p>

          <h3>Seongeup Folk Village</h3>
					<p>
						<img src="../images/Seongeup.jpg" alt="Seongeup" class="imgLeft" />
						Located at the foot of Halla Mountain on Jeju Island, Seongeup Folk Village
					 is a small town that holds a vast amount of culture.
					 Cultural properties in the folk village have been handed down from generation
					 to generation and include treasures such as residential houses, Confucian
					 shrines and schools, ancient government offices, stone statues, large
					 millstones (pulled by horses or ox), fortress ruins, and stone monuments. Among
					 the cultural gems of the folk village are intangible cultural assets such as
					 folk plays, native foods, local folk craftsmanship, and local dialect. Even the
					 trees are an important part of the area’s heritage. Several zelkova and nettle
					 trees that are hundreds of years old stand at the center of the village,
					 preserving the dignified atmosphere of a bygone era. </p>
          <h3>Jeju Folk Village Museum</h3>
					<p>With a total of 117 houses and facilities, Jeju Folk Village has restored the
					 scenes of the village to that of the 1890’s. Among them are Mountain Village,
					 Hill-Country Village, Fishing Village and Shamanism Village. On land of more
					 than 40 acres it has been reconstructed following long-term research and
					 analysis of experts. Some of the extensive range of folk items on display are
					 1,627 woodenware, 1,046 bamboo ware, 1,699 earthenware, 1,544 porcelain ware,
					 765 wax candles, 921 ironware and 579 other items. The Jeju Folk Village is the
					 island’s main tourist attraction where customs of the old days can be
					 explored.</p>

					 resort in Korea. It is located on the seashore of Jungmun area in Seogwipo. Its
